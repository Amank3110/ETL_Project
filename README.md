# Data Engineering Project

## Description

This project showcases my expertise as a Data Engineer, focusing on ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and data analysis. It includes two key projects: ETL Pipeline Development and Data Loading to Snowflake.

## ETL Pipeline Development

- Led the design and implementation of a robust ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and AWS services.
- Extracted data from an API, performed comprehensive transformations, and loaded it into an S3 bucket.
- Ensured data integrity, segregation by date, and efficient storage for subsequent analysis.
- Successfully handled large volumes of data with high accuracy.

## Data Loading to Snowflake

- Designed and executed a seamless data loading process from an S3 bucket to Snowflake.
- Developed a shell script leveraging Snowflake's COPY INTO command for efficient loading into designated tables.
- Ensured optimal data transfer and maintained data integrity throughout the process.
- Streamlined the overall ETL workflow for improved efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- AWS Services (S3)
- Snowflake
- Shell Scripting
- SQL (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## Installation

To run this project, ensure that you have the following software and tools installed:

1. Python: Install Python by downloading the installer from the official website and following the installation instructions specific to your operating system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Amazon CLI (Command Line Interface): Install the AWS CLI by following the installation instructions provided in the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).

3. SnowSQL: Install SnowSQL by following the installation instructions provided in the [SnowSQL User Guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-install-config.html).

4. Ubuntu or Bash: For running shell scripts, ensure you have either Ubuntu or Bash installed on your system. Ubuntu can be installed as a separate operating system, while Bash is typically available by default on Linux and macOS systems. For Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Git Bash.

5. Sublime Text or PyCharm: You can use either Sublime Text or PyCharm as your preferred code editor for working on the project. Download and install the editor of your choice from their respective websites.

6. Amazon Web Services (AWS): Sign up for an AWS account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and set up your credentials for accessing AWS services.

7. Snowflake Data Warehouse: Sign up for a Snowflake account at [snowflake.com](https://www.snowflake.com/) and configure the necessary credentials and connection details for accessing the Snowflake data warehouse.
## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have installed Python, Amazon CLI, SnowSQL, and either Ubuntu or Bash on your system.
2. Set up your AWS credentials by configuring the AWS CLI using the `aws configure` command.
3. Configure your Snowflake credentials by following the instructions provided in the SnowSQL User Guide.
4. Clone this repository to your local machine.
5. Open the project in your preferred code editor, such as Sublime Text or PyCharm.
6. Review the code files to understand the ETL pipeline development and data loading processes.
7. Modify the code as needed to adapt it to your specific use case and data sources.
8. Execute the scripts and pipelines to extract, transform, and load the data into Snowflake.
9. Analyze the data and draw conclusions using SQL queries and analysis techniques.
10. Experiment with different configurations and transformations to optimize the ETL workflow.

## Project Structure

The project follows the following structure:

```
- properties/
  - myProject_Access.properties
  - myProject_Directory.properties
- shell/
  - feed_name_etl_script.sh
  - feed_name_main_script.sh
  - feed_name_script_sample.sh
- pythonScript/
  - client.ini
  - config.ini
  - myPractice.py
  - s3_transfer.py
  - utilities.py
- sqlScript/
  - feed_name_Final_table.sql
  - feed_name_Inter_table.sql
  - feed_name_s3ToSnowflake.sql
- README.md
```

- The `properties` directory contains the properties files (`myProject_Access.properties` and `myProject_Directory.properties`) that store access credentials and directory configurations for the project.
- The `shell` directory includes the shell scripts (`feed_name_etl_script.sh`, `feed_name_main_script.sh`, and `feed_name_script_sample.sh`) used for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- The `pythonScript` directory contains Python scripts (`client.ini`, `config.ini`, `myPractice.py`, `s3_transfer.py`, and `utilities.py`) that handle various data processing tasks.
- The `sqlScript` directory includes SQL scripts (`feed_name_Final_table.sql`, `feed_name_Inter_table.sql`, and `feed_name_s3ToSnowflake.sql`) used for creating final tables, intermediate tables, and transferring data from S3 to Snowflake.
- The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, including the project structure, instructions, and contact information.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the project structure, and you may have additional files or directories depending on your specific implementation.
